## üìã Risk Register Overview

This document identifies, assesses, and tracks risks throughout the Firefly project lifecycle. Risks are categorized by probability, impact, and mitigation strategies to ensure proactive risk management.

### Risk Assessment Scale

**Probability Scale (1-5)**:
- 1 = Very Low (0-10%)
- 2 = Low (11-30%)
- 3 = Medium (31-50%)
- 4 = High (51-80%)
- 5 = Very High (81-100%)

**Impact Scale (1-5)**:
