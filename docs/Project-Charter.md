## 📋 Project Overview

### Project Name
**Firefly** - Augmented Reality Speed Dating Application

### Project Description
Firefly is an innovative mobile application that combines augmented reality (AR) technology with speed dating concepts to create meaningful connections in virtual environments. The app addresses critical pain points in traditional dating platforms by enabling authentic face-to-face interactions without physical travel requirements.

### Business Case
Current dating applications suffer from high user dissatisfaction rates, with only 26% of users reporting positive experiences. Key issues include:
- Superficial interactions and endless swiping
- Catfishing and misleading profiles
- Time-consuming processes with low conversion rates
- Safety concerns for in-person meetings
- Difficulty forming genuine connections

Firefly addresses these challenges by providing immersive AR experiences that simulate real-life dating scenarios while maintaining safety and convenience.
